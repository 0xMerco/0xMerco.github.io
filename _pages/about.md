Hi! I go by Merc0 and work by day as a sysadmin for big company. I want to get a handle on the technical side of cyber security and am starting Hack The Box ([HTB](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiCi7_lnd74AhXiK0QIHaq6AxkQFnoECAsQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hackthebox.com%2F&usg=AOvVaw0PVHn4XV1bDTqGHH0aqRYz)) to get good and learn some skills. My Current goal is to get "Hacker" rank, but I plan to take my time in order to fully grasp concepts.

The point of this blogsite is to record my progress as well as push TTPs, Writeups and anything else I find interesting. 

Enjoy!!!
